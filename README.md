# BODY FAT PREDICTION

# INTRODUCTION :
Commonly used statistical models to predict body fat percentage currently rely on skinfold measures, anthropometric measures, or some combination of the two but do not account for the wide ranges of age and body mass index (BMI) present in the American adult population. The objective of this study was to develop a statistical regression model to predict in vivo body fat percentage (dual energy X‚Äêray) in men and women across significant age and obesity ranges.

# DENSITY :
A person's body density depends on how much fat and fat-free mass he carries. Fat is found under the skin, around the internal organs, as an essential part of the central nervous system, as part of the structure of some internal organs and inside the bone marrow. The density of fat is fairly consistent at 0.91 kilogram per liter and is less dense that most of your fat-free mass.

# BODY FAT :
The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions.

# WEIGHT :
a body's relative mass or the quantity of matter contained by it, giving rise to a downward force; the heaviness of a person or thing.

# HEIGHT :
the measurement of someone or something from head to foot or from base to top.

# NECK :
The neck is the start of the spinal column and spinal cord. The spinal column contains about two dozen inter-connected, oddly shaped, bony segments, called vertebrae. The neck contains seven of these, known as the cervical vertebrae. They are the smallest and uppermost vertebrae in the body.

# CHEST : 
the front surface of a person's or animal's body between the neck and the stomach.

# ABDOMEN : 
the part of the body of a vertebrate containing the digestive and reproductive organs; the belly.

# HIP : 
a projection of the pelvis and upper thigh bone on each side of the body in human beings and quadrupeds.

# THIGH :
the part of the human leg between the hip and the knee.

# KNEE : 
the joint between the thigh and the lower leg in humans.

# ANKLE :
the joint connecting the foot with the leg.

# BICEPS :
any of several muscles having two points of attachment at one end.

# FOREARM :
the part of a person's arm extending from the elbow to the wrist or the fingertips.

# WRIST :
the joint connecting the hand with the forearm.
